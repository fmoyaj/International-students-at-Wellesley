# International-students-at-Wellesley
Data science project exploring the international student community at Wellesley College. This repository contains two notebooks detailing the collection and analysis of two data sets surrounding international students at Wellesley College. This research uses international student data and alum data as primary sources, but the alum data set was not included in this repository due to privacy concerns.


### Project Motivation
International students come to Wellesley College from all over the world. With approximately 50 countries represented every year, the international student community brings a diverse set of ideas, backgrounds, and cultures to the Wellesley College campus. As a diverse community that comes together at Wellesley, we are always looking to understand where we come from and where we are headed. If we understand who we are, we can make connections with other international students who came before us to learn from their experiences; we can empower future generations to overcome the academic, professional, and personal challenges that international students encounter. This project seeks to bring attention to aspects of the international student community that are often overlooked, but have the potential to help us understand this group of students on a deeper level. We aim to find commonalities among Wellesley College alums' paths, and make that information available to members of the international student community and prospective international students.
