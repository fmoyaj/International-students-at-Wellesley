    "# Scraping the Wellesley Hive Using Selenium\n",

    "In an effort to answer the question: What are Wellesley College international alumnae doing now?, we decided to scrape the Wellesley Hive, a social network for Wellesley College students and alumni, for information on international alumni. We were especially interested in collecting alumni's graduation date, their current location, their job experience, and their education. This notebook uses Selenium to log into the Wellesley Hive, perform a search to find users who are international alums, downloading the user content, and to visit each users' profile to scrape the information of interest.

    "The Hive has a search functionality that can be used to find users based on specific criteria, such as class year or extracurricular involvement. One of these criteria allows us to search users based on their international student status, but many international alums chose to not display this information on their profile. After trying different combinations of criteria, we decided to search for alums who had participated in the Slater International Student Organization. The majority of the students who participate in Slater are international students, and a few are domestic students who have ties to the international community. This search yielded 229 exact results.\n",
